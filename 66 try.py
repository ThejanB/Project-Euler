# Explanation:
# The equation x^2 - Dy^2 = 1 is a Pell's equation. We can solve it using the continued fraction expansion of sqrt(D).
# The continued fraction expansion of sqrt(D) can be represented as [a0; (a1, a2, ..., a2k)].
# The convergents of the continued fraction expansion are p0/q0, p1/q1, ..., p2k/q2k.
# The convergents satisfy the following recurrence relations:
# p(-1) = 0, p(0) = 1, p(n) = a(n) * p(n-1) + p(n-2)
# q(-1) = 1, q(0) = 0, q(n) = a(n) * q(n-1) + q(n-2)
# The convergents p(n)/q(n) are the best rational approximations to sqrt(D) with denominator less than q(n).
# The convergents p(n)/q(n) satisfy the Pell's equation x^2 - Dy^2 = (-1)^n.
# We can generate the convergents of sqrt(D) using the recurrence relations and check if they satisfy the Pell's equation.
# If we find a convergent that satisfies the Pell's equation, we can stop and return the corresponding x value.
# We iterate over all D values from 2 to 1000 and find the D value that produces the largest minimal x value.
# The answer is the D value that produces the largest minimal x value.
# The solution runs in a reasonable time for the given input range.
# The time complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the limit value (1000 in this case).
